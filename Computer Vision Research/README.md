# Computer Vision Research

Our application is expected to recognize the clothing a person wears:

1. After a user downloads the app, they need to take a photo of all the elements of their clothes. The labels should be applied automatically, but the user should still be able to name them as they like.
2. Each time a user uses the application, they either upload a photo or just show the look in real life.
3. **The purpose of this research is*** to understand how we can recognize which pieces of clothing from the initially entered wardrobe the person is currently wearing.

**Important to note that we don't want to use any APIs/tools that would require Prof to register for them.**

### Example of the deliverable:

**Computer Vision Approaches**

A structured comparison of possible methods, for example:
- **Image classification**
- **Object detection**
- **Instance segmentation**
- **Feature matching / embedding-based similarity**
- **On-device ML vs. local server vs. open-source models**

Each method should include:
- What it does
- Pros/cons
- Suitability for this app

**Model Options** 
Since the requirement is *no APIs requiring registration*, the deliverable should list:
- Open-source models (e.g., YOLO variants, MobileNet, CLIP, SAM)
- Their strengths/limitations for clothing recognition
- Hardware requirements (mobile vs. server)
- Expected accuracy

A comparison table is ideal.

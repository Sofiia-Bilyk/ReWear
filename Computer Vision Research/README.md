# Computer Vision Research

Our application is expected to recognize the clothing a person wears:

1. After a user downloads the app, they need to take a photo of all the elements of their clothes. The labels should be applied automatically, but the user needs to have the possibility to name them as they like.
2. Each time a user uses the application, they either upload a photo or just show the look in real life.
3. We need to recognize what pieces of clothes from the initially entered wardrobe the person is currently wearing.
4. Important to note that we don't want to use any APIs/tools that would require Prof to register for them.
